# IslamEd-Redesign-
UI draft for IslamEd redesign 

This is my initial draft for a redesign of the IslamEd eLearning platform. The build version of the website included an additional page with links to the blog page and the platforms YouTube channel.  

If you tried to view the website using the link on my LinkedIn page, you will notice that the website is currently down. The website has been rebuilt from the ground up with a much-improved design and more robust tool set enabling new ways to learn. This new website is not yet live and I am not at liberty to share my design work on the project.
